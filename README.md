# Numerical-modeling-with-python

Using python's libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Scipy, and Mayavi for advanced 3D visualization, we were able to perform numerical modeling for engineering tasks, using the finite-difference discretization method. 
-In the first example we consider it a cubic meter of water, linked to a fixed source of temperature, and compute after a time step of choosing, the heat conduction in water using the parabolic P.D.E of heat equation.
